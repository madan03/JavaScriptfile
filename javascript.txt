1. Difference Between JAVA and JAVASCRPTI??
Java:
    OOP programming language, Creates appln that are run in a vm or browser ,need to be complied.
Javascript:
    OOP scripting language, code is run on a browser only, code is all in the form of text.

2.What are the features of Javascript??
    ->It is lightweight,interpreted programming language.
    ->It is designed for creating networkcentric appln.
    ->It is an open and cross-platform scripting language.

3.Advantage of Javascript
    ->Less server interaction:less load on server
    ->Immediate feedback to the visitors
    ->Increase interactivity.

4.In how many ways a Javascript code can be involves in an HTML file?
    ->Inline
    ->Internal
    ->External

    2.Assignment operators:
        ( +=, -=, *= ,/=)
    3.Comparision Operator: 
    (   x == y) , (x <= y), (x >=y) (x <y ), (x >y)
    4.logical Operator:
        4.1 AND Operator(&&)
        4.2 OR Operator(||)
        4.3 NOT operator(!)
*JAVASCRPTI FUNCTION:
    A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, 
    followed by parentheses ().
     function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
    }
*CONDITIONS OF JAVASCRPTI:
1.if statement:
2.if-else statement:
3.if-else ladder:

*LOOP IN JAVASCRPTI:
1.FOR:
    Loops through a block of code a number of times
2.WHILE:
    Loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true   
3.DO-WHILE:
    Also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

*Break in javascript:
    The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.
*continue in javascript:
    The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
